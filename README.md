## An attempt to understand Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

This repo contains solution to the part of the assignment-3 of CS231n-2017 focused on understanding and implementing vanilla GAN, LS-GAN (Least Square), DCGAN on MNIST dataset. Implemented using TensorFlow library.
BTW, you can find my previous year CS231n assignment solutions [here](https://github.com/JJashim/Stanford-CS231n).
